A.  The intertemporal stability of income attainment 
       (data: gss1988_1999.dat)
################################################################

In this assignment we focus on  structural invariance . We are 
going to analyze the Blau-Duncan path model for different years, 
and test whether the path coefficients have changed over time.  

The General Social Survey is a yearly repeated US national 
survey with a largely fixed set of questions; see, e.g., 
http://webapp.icpsr.umich.edu/GSS/ for details. For the period 
1988-1998 I collected the following variables in the file 
GSS1988_1999.dat. NOTE: missing values are coded as 9999. Make 
sure that 9999s are coded as missings when you read data in R.

Survey year 1988 to 1998 (YEAR)
Respondent s AGE;
Respondent s SEX;
Respondent s RACE;
Number of brothers and sisters (SIBS) of Respondent;
Respondent s number of years of education (EDUC);
Number of years of education of Respondent s father (PAEDUC);
Number of years of education of Respondent s mother (MAEDUC);
Number of years of education of Respondent s spouse (SPEDUC);
Respondent s occupational prestige (SEI) score;
Respondent s income (RINCOME).

Make yourself familiar with the variable values. Note that for 
the RINCOME variable, categories of income have been used. In 
this exercise, we'll use this variable as if it was continuous.  

We study the following model: 

EDUC    is affected by PAEDUC and SIBS; 
SEI     is affected by EDUC; and 
RINCOME is affected by EDUC and SEI.

(1)	Perform a multiple group analysis, comparing the path 
coefficients in the years 1988, 1993, and 1998. You are also free 
to compare the other model parameters (error variances, the
means and covariances of the exogenous variables, and the 
intercepts for the endogenous variables). 

(2)	Diff-in-Diff: test that the differences in effects  
between 88-93 are the same as the differences between 93-98. 
* Think about how to analyze the data for all years 1988-1998 
in order to test linearity of effects over time.
